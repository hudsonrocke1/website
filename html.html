    <h3>Break Line</h3>
    <p>Break line is used to skip a line. Its syntax is &lt;br&gt;</p>
    <h3>Horizontal Rule</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The line above this sentence is a line called a horizontal rule and is made with &lt;hr&gt;</p>
    <h3>Specail Codes</h3>
    <p>Do you know how I can insert &lt;, &gt;, &quot; and, &amp; ?<br>There are many special codes that do certain things like make a dollar sign!<p>
    <h3>Lists</h3>
    <p>Lists are ordered pairs. Imagine having a shopping list. Here are some lists:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First Bullet Point</li>
      <li>Second Bullet Point</li>
      <li>Third Bullet Point</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>First Element</li>
      <li>Second Element</li>
      <li>Third Element</li>
    </ol>
    <p>That was a list you just witnessed in all of it's glory. Here is the syntax for a bullet list:<br><br>&lt;ul&gt;<br>&emsp;&lt;li&gt;(text)&lt;li&gt;<br>&emsp;&lt;li&gt;(text)&lt;li&gt;<br>&emsp;&lt;li&gt;(text)&lt;li&gt;<br>&lt;ul&gt;</p>
    <p><br>And here is code for an ordered list:<br><br>&lt;ol&gt;<br>&emsp;&lt;li&gt;(text)&lt;li&gt;<br>&emsp;&lt;li&gt;(text)&lt;li&gt;<br>&emsp;&lt;li&gt;(text)&lt;li&gt;<br>&lt;ol&gt;</p>
    <h3><br>CSS</h3>
    <p>Now it is time to explore CSS! This groovy language will add some style baby!<br>CSS stands for cascading style sheets.</p>
    <pink>This text is a dark pink color.</pink>
    <p>That text was dark pink! But how?<br>By using CSS and assigning the tag &lt;pink&gt; to that color text,<br>anything with that tag has the variables assigned to it in the css script!</p>
    <p>Here is the code that did it:<br><br>pink {<br>&emsp;color: #E75480<br>}</p>
    <p>I will break this down. By assigning the &lt;pink&gt; tag to have a color of #E75480, aka pink,<br>any text with this flag will now have that property of pink.<br><br>Here is a table of every CSS value and what it does:<p>
